<h2>Rock vs Mine Prediction Model</h2>

<p>This project implements a machine learning classification model to predict whether an object detected by sonar signals is a rock or a mine. The model is trained using numerical features extracted from sonar returns and demonstrates a practical application of supervised learning in binary classification. The project was developed using Python in a Google Colab environment.</p>
